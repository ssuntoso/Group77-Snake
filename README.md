## Game description
A single-player game in which the user inputs an arrow key to move a snake which moves constantly forward towards the input direction. The game challenges the user to keep the snake alive by touching a randomized food position since there is a countdown which can change the food position randomly. To make the game dynamic and hard, the snake’s length will increase as it touches food and if the snake touches its own body, the snake will die. Highest score will be counted as the snake touches food, this increases the competitiveness of the user while playing the game.

## Rules & how to play:
1. Game starts from the center of the board when the player clicks one of the arrow buttons.
2. The snake will move at constant speed and only move up, down, left, and right.
3. Food will appear at a random location for 30 seconds. If players manage to eat it—by passing the snake head on the food during that time frame, the snake will get longer for one square and the player receives 1 point. Otherwise, food will move to different locations.
4. There is only one food at a time. 
5. If the snake runs to the edge of the box, it will continue to the other side(bottom of the box will continue from the top, left will continue at right, and vice-versa). 
6. Game ends when the snake eats their own body.
